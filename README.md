<a href="https://github.com/seemskk/Information-Design/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The repository puts together the student work from **info-graphics** course for 3rd year UG Communication Design conducted at DJ Academy of Design in 2017. 

The 1-2 week module is a process oriented course that takes through the concept - storyboard - execution - digitising/ presenation stages. Students were encouraged to pick their own data/information rich themes to convert to easily consumbale info-graphics format for a magazine spread.
